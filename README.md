# Statistical Models Implementations #

This is my repo with the implementations of some of the statistical models. Right now it includes models such as:
- k-NN (quantitative)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Multinomial Naive Bayes

I've been doing machine learning for over a month now and I wanted to share my progress. I'm open to any feedback/criticism.

More models are coming - right now, I'm working on Decision Trees/Random Forests.

## Running the models ##
To run the models, start by cloning the project:
bash```
git clone https://github.com/IamMax279/models_implementations.git
```
